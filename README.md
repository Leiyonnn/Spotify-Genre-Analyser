# Spotify Genre Analyzer

### A Data Science Project for Music Analytics and Playlist Generation

Spotify Genre Analyser is an interactive **Flask web app** that connects to the **Spotify Web API** to analyse a user's playlists and listening habits.  
It performs **data extraction**, **genre aggregation**, and **statistical visualisation** of your Spotify library — all within a visually interactive dashboard.

The app also allows users to **automatically create new playlists** based on specific genres, making it both an **analytical tool** and a **data-driven recommender system**.
